Title: G7 Shouldn't be America and Japan's Tool for Attacking China

Japanese media is stating the for the first time in its history, the meeting of world leaders known as the G7 will join in criticizing China for its "use of unilateral force in attempting to shape the situation" in the South China Sea. In an effort to stifle China's imminent rise, the U.S. has enthusiastically resumed its Cold War line of thinking and attempted to hem China by surrounding it on the Eurasian continent. While this won't succeed, it does demonstrate America's tactic of showing outward strength as it suffers from inner weakness. Europe and China are not engaged in geopolitical conflict, on the contrary the, with regard to strengthening cooperative dialogue and establishing new geopolitical dynamics there has been excellent cooperation around mutual benefit. Asia can't allow the U.S. to do as it pleases and use the G7 as a tool for attacking China. China and Europe should establish an ironclad relationship for the purpose of safeguarding global peace and economic development.
