</span>China&apos;s efforts to build Eastern coastal defenses over the last 10 years have come under intense scrutiny for violating anti-air defense agreements made by the U.S., Japan and other complicit nations in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s. According to an ABC news report published on Nov. 23, China&apos;s recent announcements to bolster its late-to-the-game air defenses prompted both U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel to issue separate statements saying that the U.S. was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about these developments. <br>
<br>
From the same article, Kerry was quoted in Geneva, Switzerland as stating that, &quot;This unilateral action constitutes an attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea,&quot; and that &quot;Escalatory action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident.&quot; Apart from these statements, America has already urged &#x201C;caution and restraint&#x201D; on China&apos;s part, warning China not to carry out its plans to fortify the air defense zone.* <br>
<br>
Defense Secretary Hagel has stated repeatedly that the situation involving the Diaoyu Islands relates to the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty, according to which the U.S. would support its ally Japan if military conflict were to occur. He declared that both the U.S. and Japan &quot;would act to meet the common danger&quot; according to &quot;constitutional provisions and processes&quot; in response to an armed attack on Japanese territory.<br>
<br>
With regard to &#x201C;criticism&#x201D; from the American side, a representative of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Qin Gang, answered reporters&#x2019; questions on Nov. 24 and stated that regarding the sovereignty of the Diaoyu Islands, the U.S. should earnestly oppose choosing a side or taking an opinion one way or another. Qin stated that the Chinese government&apos;s plans to fortify its eastern coastline were in accordance with the U.N. Charter, international law and international conventions with objectives of securing the safety and sovereignty of China&apos;s territorial air space, without specifying any foreign nations, and do not affect their rights to fly through it.<br>
<br>
Qin emphasized that the Diaoyu Islands are China&apos;s native territory and that China staunchly affirms its sovereignty over them. The current state of affairs is entirely the result of Japan&apos;s erroneous behavior, and America should adopt a position of neutrality on the issue and revoke its statements in support of Japan.<br>
